EduDefine always tries to bring a change in the Education Sector by conducting a highly revelant seminar on how to use the Theory of Multiple Intelligence postulated by Dr. Howard Gardner, well known psychologist and professor at Harward University.
The seminar was handled by Mr Paul Maliakkal and Mr. N M Hussain recognised Multiple Intelligence Analysts of EduDefine. It was well accepted by the Principal and teacher of SCAD World School. Our heartfelt thanks for the Principal and teachers for giving us such an opportunity.

Everyone has some degree of learning style. Understanding them is significant because when your child prefers one learning style over another, it affects his or her success. Do you have the ways to identify every student's style of learning?

How a teacher can easily manage the students in a classroom?
Would you like to upgrade your school to be the centre of excellence in both scholastic and co-scholastic areas?
